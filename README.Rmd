## Overview

The goal of `volcalc` is to automate calculating estimates of volatility for chemical compounds.

**`volcalc` is a work in progress---use at your own risk!**

It is still in a stage of development likely to introduce many breaking changes.  For a bit of a road map of where development is headed, see our [proposal](https://cct-datascience.github.io/volcalc-isc-proposal/) for the R Consortium grant.


Volatility can be estimated for most chemical compounds that are in the [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/) database, using just the [KEGG unique identifier](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/compound/) for the compound of interest.
Alternatively, volatility can be estimated for multiple compounds that are in a [KEGG pathway](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html).

## Installation

### Using without installing

You can use the `volcalc` package by using RStudio on a server [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Meredith-Lab/binder_volcalc/master?urlpath=rstudio).
This instance can be slow to launch.

The instance was generated using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), which is an excellent free, open source tool to create custom computing environments.

To see an example of how to use `volcalc`, run the script `example_volcalc_usage.R` which is included in the server's file system.

### Installing locally

You can install the development version of `volcalc` from GitHub with

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("Meredith-Lab/volcalc")
```

Or from r-universe with

``` r
options(repos = c('https://cct-datascience.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
pak::pkg_install('volcalc')
```

You can install the 'legacy' version used in our in-prep publication with

``` r
pak::pkg_install("Meredith-Lab/volcalc@v1.0.2")
```

Installation of `volcalc` requires the system libraries [OpenBabel](https://openbabel.org/) and Eigen3 (requirements of the `ChemmineOB` package, which `volcalc` depends on). `pak` will take care of the installation of these libraries for you on some systems, but you may need to install them manually.

For macOS, they can be installed via homebrew by running the following shell command:

``` bash
brew install open-babel
```

For Ubuntu Linux:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install libopenbabel-dev
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
```

For windows, `OpenBabel` is included in the `ChemmineOB` binary and does not need to be installed separately.

For other installation options see the [OpenBabel documentation](https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html) and `ChemmineOB` [install guide](https://github.com/girke-lab/ChemmineOB/blob/master/INSTALL)

### Loading package

Use the package with:

```{r}
library(volcalc)
```

## Single compound usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to get a volatility estimate for an example compound *beta-2,3,4,5,6-Pentachlorocyclohexanol*.
The KEGG compound identifier for the compound, as found on [the compound's KEGG page](https://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?C16181), is *C16181*.

#### Single function approach

```{r}
out_path <- tempdir()
calc_vol(compound_id = "C16181", path = out_path)
```

This returns a dataframe with columns specifying general info about the compound, and the compound's calculated volatility and corresponding volatility category.
The functional group counts underlying the volatility can be additionally returned with `return_fx_groups = TRUE`, and the intermediate calculation steps with `return_calc_steps = TRUE`.
A list of all possible dataframe columns is included below.

There are other possible input arguments to the function.
The compound can alternatively be specified with its chemical formula using the `compound_formula` argument instead of `compound_id` as in the example.
The KEGG pathway that a compound is part of can be included with the `pathway_id` argument, which will generate a data subfolder for all compounds in that specified pathway.
You can specify where the compound files are downloaded by setting the desired relative path using `path = "path/to/folder"`; otherwise, the path will be in a `data` folder in the current directory.
If the underlying data file for a compound has already been downloaded in the specified path, it will not be downloaded again unless `redownload = TRUE`.

#### Multiple function approach

This breaks the steps done by `calc_vol` into three parts: 1) download the compound's .mol file from KEGG, 2) count occurrences of different functional groups, and 3) estimate volatility.
This calculation uses the SIMPOL approach[^1].

```{r}
save_compound_mol(compound_id = "C16181", path = out_path)
example_compound_fx_groups <-
  get_fx_groups(compound_id = "C16181", path = out_path)
example_compound_vol <-
  calc_vol(compound_id = "C16181",
           fx_groups_df = example_compound_fx_groups,
           path = out_path)
print(example_compound_vol$volatility)
```

This example compound has a volatility around `r round(example_compound_vol$volatility, 0)`.
It is in the `r example_compound_vol$category` volatility category.

Many of the arguments described for `calc_vol` can be used in these intermediate functions.
See function documentation for details.

## Multiple compounds from a pathway usage

A dataframe with volatility estimates for all compounds in a chosen pathway can be returned as below.

```{r}
example_pathway_vol <- calc_pathway_vol("map00361", path = out_path)
print(example_pathway_vol[1,])
```
